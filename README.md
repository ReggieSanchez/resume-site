# Cloud Resume Project – Reggie Sanchez

🚀 A live, cloud-hosted resume built on AWS using S3, CloudFront, and Route 53 — deployed with Terraform and secured with HTTPS. This project serves as both my resume and a showcase of practical cloud and DevOps skills.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I wanted to challenge myself and create something that goes beyond the typical resume — something cloud-native, production-grade, and developer-forward. This project allowed me to showcase real-world skills like infrastructure as code, cloud automation, and polished front-end delivery — all backed by AWS.
